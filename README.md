# K-Means Customer Segmentation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **customer segmentation** using the **K-Means clustering algorithm** as part of my **machine learning internship at Prodigy Infotech**. The goal is to analyze customer data, identify patterns, and group customers into meaningful segments based on their purchasing behavior, demographics, or other relevant features.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Implement K-Means clustering** to segment customers effectively.
- **Analyze customer behavior** based on different attributes such as spending habits, age, income, and more.
- **Visualize the clustered data** using graphs and charts for better interpretation.
- **Optimize the number of clusters (K) using the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score**.
- **Draw actionable insights** that businesses can use to tailor marketing strategies, improve customer experience, and boost sales.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (for data processing and machine learning)
- **Scikit-learn** (for implementing K-Means)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for coding and analysis)

## 🔍 Dataset
The dataset used for segmentation could be customer transaction data, e-commerce user data, or retail customer information. It typically includes attributes like:
- **Customer ID**
- **Annual Income**
- **Spending Score**
- **Age / Gender**
- **Purchase Frequency**

## 📊 Expected Outcomes
- **Clear customer segments** that differentiate various groups based on purchasing behavior.
- **Visualization of clusters** to identify trends and patterns.
- **Business insights** that help in targeted marketing, personalized offers, and better customer engagement.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/kmeans-customer-segmentation.git
   cd kmeans-customer-segmentation
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open the `.ipynb` file and execute the cells step by step.
